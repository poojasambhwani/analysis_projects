# User Profiling and Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze user behavior and segment users into meaningful groups using clustering techniques. The insights derived from this segmentation help in understanding user engagement, preferences, and online activity patterns.

## 🚀 Features

 - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Clustering Technique (K-Means)

- Data Visualization (Radar Charts, Count Plots, etc.)

- Interpretation of Clusters

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information on user behavior, including:

- Time Spent Online (Weekday & Weekend)

- Likes and Reactions

- Click-Through Rates (CTR)

- Demographic Attributes (Age, Gender, etc.)

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## 🏗️ Usage

- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

- Perform data preprocessing (handle missing values, normalize data, etc.).

- Apply clustering algorithms to segment users.

- Visualize clusters using count plots, radar charts, and other graphs.

- Interpret the segments for actionable insights.
